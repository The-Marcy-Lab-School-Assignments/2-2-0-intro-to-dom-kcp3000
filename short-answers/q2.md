# Question
Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

The difference between HTMLCollections and NodeLists is that HTMLCollections is specific to only HTML elements (like <[span]>, <[a]>, etc...) while NodeLists is HTML elements and the information within those tags.

Both of them are similar to arrays as they have a list of items but the main difference is that array methods don't work on them (besides NodeLists but only with forEach method).
